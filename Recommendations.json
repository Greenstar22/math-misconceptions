When will Mary and Larry have the same amount of money? \nThe rates for Larry's and Mary's earnings are the same, and the graphs therefore go up at the same rate; that is, the slopes are the same. The graphs of Larry's earnings (y=30x+20) and Mary's earnings (y=30x-50) are parallel. We know this without even making the graphs because the rates (or slopes) are the same.

The task is for the learner to determine whether the second text is different or not, and if it is, to report how it is different. The idea is that changes that are noticed re\ufb02ect deeper surface-level processing of the original text, whereas changes that are not noticed re\ufb02ect shallow processing of surface features.  But rather than changing the text at the word level, make changes in the word order of the original text.

For example, the relationship between 3 and 8 is always the same. To determine the relationship between two numbers, the numbers must implicitly represent a count made by using the same unit. But when units are different, these relationships change.\nHave learners compare quantities with different units and decimals, in order to observe that relationships between numbers are not always fixed","Example 2":"The relationship between 3 and 8 is not always the same.\nThree dozen eggs is more than eight eggs, and three feet is more than eight inches, -3 is bigger than -8 and -0.3 is bigger than -0.80","Recommendation Description 3":"Learners may have the wrong idea that \"-x Is Negative x\". For these students, then, -x means that the value of this expression will always be negative. This is problematic for students when x represents a negative number. If students consistently read the expression as the opposite of x, it would help them make sense of the expression. Make learners solve problems involving negative numbers and variables, calling them each time \"the opposite of __\" rather than \"negative __\". Ask learners to do the same way when they read expressions and work on solving algebra exercises.","Example 3":"For example, in an equation such as x+4=2, the students believe that it is impossible to find the negative value of x. Students also attempt to avoid negative solutions to equations, involving, for example, changing the structure of an equation or a problem definition in order to obtain a positive solution.\nWhere the unknown is preceded by a minus sign, confusion arises regarding the sign of the solution. With equations such as 4-x=5 or -x=6, they are no longer sure if the minus sign is a subtraction sign  or if it is part of a negative number.","Recommendation Description 4":"Learners may have the wrong idea that \"The Absolute Value of a Number Is Just the Number\". Students sometimes maintain the belief that the absolute value of a number is that same number with a positive sign because the negative sign is simply dropped. Confusion often occurs students carry this misunderstanding to algebraic contexts because they are unsure how it might be possible that -|-x| = x. Without understanding that the true meaning of an absolute value is its distance from zero on a number line, students may continue to have trouble interpreting absolute value scenarios that are more complex.\nStudents have difficulty accepting that |x| can be -x, because this evokes the feeling of contradiction to their perception of an absolute value as a positive number.\nMake learners solve exercises involving absolute value in different scenarios, in order to provide feedback and correct the wrong idea that the absolute value is just the number without sign.","Example 4":"For example:  |x-2|<1, x-2<1, x<3\nStudents do not distinguish between |a|, the value of which is positive or 0 and is never negative, and the value of a, which can be positive, negative, or 0."},{"Misconception":"students commit a reversal order error","ID":"MaE56","Topic":"Equations and inequalities","Recommendation Description 1":"Review and reinforce these BIG IDEAS:\nMultiplication involves counting groups of equal size and determining how many are in all (multiplicative thinking) or using a reference set as a unit in a multiplicative comparison. \r\nMultiplication and division are related.

When a student commits a reversal order error, ask the learner if there is an issue in understanding the statement, or what is their mother tongue, then provide a rod-by-word translation if necessary.","Example 2":"Example:\nThere are seven times less canaries than parakeets in a pet shop.\nHay siete veces menos canarios que periquitos en una tienda de animales.\n\nThis is a multiplicative, decreasing relationship","Recommendation Description 3":"Apply with learners the \"text-change paradigm\", also known as the \"change-detection paradigm\". This paradigm consists in that students are given a text of some sort to read on a computer screen, and then they are presented with a second text that is either identical to the \ufb01rst text or changed very slightly in some way. The task is for the learner to determine whether the second text is different or not, and if it is, to report how it is different. The idea is that changes that are noticed re\ufb02ect deeper surface-level processing of the original text, whereas changes that are not noticed re\ufb02ect shallow processing of surface features.  But rather than changing the text at the word level, make changes in the word order of the original text. When the \ufb01rst text is shown in the less helpful order, it has to be changed in the second text to the helpful order and vice versa.","Example 3":"Example:\n\n(a) In the Johnsons\u2019 garden, marigolds outnumber pansies.

Make learners practice and practice with similar word problems, until they develop their own strategy to go checking their procedure as they work. Start with the \"text-change paradigm\", where learners are given different statements of the same problem, one more helpful than the other and, once learners have practiced enough in detecting which is the most helpful statement to solve a problem, give them more problems with one single statement and ask them to solve it the best way they can. Learners will probably use the strategy to change the statement themselves, and will develop by their own the check-as-you-go strategy so solve problems.","Example 4":"Example:\nThe window display at Jack\u2019s boot shop showcases both black and tan leather boots.
