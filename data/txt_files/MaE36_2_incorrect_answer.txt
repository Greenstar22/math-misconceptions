[The learner represented the problem with a bar graph, labeled on the vertical axis with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The first graph size is 4, the second bar seems to be size 6, the third bar is size 4, the fourth bar is size 3 and there are 4 more bars which sizes are not clear and their shapes are irregular. The learner wrote scribbles instead of a label on the x-axis]
