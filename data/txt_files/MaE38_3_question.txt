From the graph presented, which group is growing faster at the age of 14?
[The graph represents the age of boys and girls on the x-axis and their average weight in kilograms, on the y-axis. The graph goes from 0 to 16 on the x-axis and from 0 to 70 on the y-axis. There are two lines: one dashed line representing the Boy's average weight in kilograms, in function of their age in years, and one solid line representing the Girl's average weight in kilograms, in function of their age in years. Both lines start resembling a straight line, but start changing into a curve-shape at 11 years]
