Two carnivals are coming to town. You and your friend decide to go to different carnivals. The carnival that you attend charges $10 to get in and an additional $2 for each ride. The carnival your friend attends charges $6 to get in, but each additional ride costs $3. If the two of you spent the same amount of money, how many rides could each of you have ridden?
