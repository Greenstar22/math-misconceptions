3*5= 15, so 3 friends can share the money but I don't know what to do with the 40 cents, because there's no way to share evenly 40 cents with 3 people. Since 3 times 5 is the same as 5 times 3, 15.4 shared by 3 has to be the same as 15.4 shared by 5, then we can also share the 15.4 dollars with 5 people, but we ignore the 40 cents.
