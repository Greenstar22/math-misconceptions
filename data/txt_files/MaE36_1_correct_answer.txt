Inferring that Logan's bags have equal amounts of marbles, each bag should have 3 (15 marbles in total, because 12+3=15 -12 he gave to Haley, plus 3 he was left with). An accurate representation would contain a drawing to represent each of Logan's bag, the 12 individual marbles he gave to Haley and the 3 marbles that both Logan and Luis had after the sharing.
