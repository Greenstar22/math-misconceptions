I'll use K for the Kit Kat bars, S for Snickers and P for Peanut Butter Cups.
K=S+22
P=K+32
P+k+S=306
If I divide 306 by 3, I get 102, there would be 102 bars of each if all were equal. Since there are more Kit Kats, I'll guess K=80.
P=80+32=112
80=S+22
80=58+22, S=58
P=112, K=80 and S=58
Checking: 112+80+58=250
Then, there are more Kit Kats...  My initial guess is wrong...
