(a) The sketch of the graph of the function's inverse is a curve representing a square root.
(b) Same data table for the original function, with the variables inverted.
  y  |  x
 19  | -4
  1  | -2
- 1  |  0  
 13  |  2 
 43  |  4
These points can be used to sketch the graph
The inverse function for a quadratic is a square root function:
f(x)=y=2x^2+3x+1
x=[(1/2)y+(1/16)]^(1/2)-(3/4)
f^-1(x)=[(1/2)y+(1/16)]^(1/2)-(3/4)
