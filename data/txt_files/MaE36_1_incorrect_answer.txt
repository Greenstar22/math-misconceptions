[Graphic representation: The learner drew 4 lines of circles trying to represent the marbles only. On the first line, he drew 12, on the second line he drew 3, on the third line he drew 5, and on the fourth line he drew 3 again. There's no representation for the bags, nor labels to specify the marbles that belong to Logan or Luis.]
