A television station charges $1,089 for a sixty-second commercial and $325 for a fifteen-second commercial. 
The television station also sells 10 minutes of commercial time for a total of $10,000. 
How much will an advertiser save if they purchase the 10-minute block of commercials instead of 7 sixty-second commercials and 12 fifteen-second commercials?
