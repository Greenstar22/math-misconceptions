Use your ruler to solve this problem.
On the grid below, graph the points (-2,4), (3,4), (2,2) and (-3,2)
[An empty cartesian plane is provided, that goes from -6 to 6 on each of the axes, increasing by one]
Now connect the points in the order listed above to make a polygon. Write the name of the polygon you drew.
