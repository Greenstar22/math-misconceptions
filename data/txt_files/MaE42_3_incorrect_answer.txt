If we spent the same amount of money, then I can calculate the money spent by each one, until it is equal and so I get the rides.
Rides     |       Money I spent    |  Money spent by my friend
  1       |             2          |             3                 
  2       |             4          |             6                   
  3       |             6          |             9                   
I would have ridden 3 rides, and my friend would have ridden 2 rides
