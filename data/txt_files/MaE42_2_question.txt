Sara has made several purchases from a mail-order company.  She has found that the company charges $12.90 to ship an 8-kg package, $6.40 to ship a 3-kg package, and $9.00 to ship a 5-kg package.  Sara decides that the company must be using a  simple rule to determine how much to charge for shipping.  Help her figure out how much it would most likely cost to ship a 1-kg package and how much each additional kilogram would cost.
