Bart is publicity painter. In the last few days, he had to paint Christmas decorations on several store windows. Yesterday, he made a drawing of a 56 cm high Father Christmas on the door of a bakery. He needed 6 ml paint.  Now he is asked to make an enlarged version of the same drawing on a supermarket window. This copy should be 168 cm high. How much paint will Bart approximately need to do this?
